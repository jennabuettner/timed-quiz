# Time Coding Quiz
This project's purpose is to create a web application featuring a code-based timed quiz. 

## Description
When the user interacts with the web application, they are greeted with the welcome page which tells them the instructions of the game and provides a button to start the quiz. When the button is clicked, the quiz starts, along with the timer countdown. They user is given 30 seconds to answer as many questions as they can before the timer runs out. If they run out of time or finish the questions, the game ends and asks for the user's information so that they can store their score. After storing the score, the user can see their score along with all other highscores.
